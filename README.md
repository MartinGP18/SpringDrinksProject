# SpringDrinksProject

Why are we doing this?
This is an example project to show that we can create an application that accepts http requests, whilst adhering to best pratcices, and hopefully demonstrating minimum viable product principles.

What went well? What didn't go as planned?
I think the initial stages of creation did go well. I was more comfortable with them on both an understanding and a practical level. Unfortunately I did get a little bit cocky, and after a good first couple of days did not manage my time as well as I should have. That has left me with a project that without 80% test coverage, which is disappointing because I was aiming to do that.
I did find out how to make a .jar file (I know it's easy, but research that goes well is always pleasing), and kept up (I think) with all relevant documentation.
Overall, I'd say I had to lean on the videos quite a lot, but I feel that I understand what is going on, and why things are structured the way they are, so I hope that that is verified after the marking.
One other thing that didn't go quite to plan was the commit branches. I figured out what I was doing wrong towards the end (i.e. I hadn't committed on dev branch, which meant that git treated my feature branches as a kind of 're-labelled dev'.

Possible improvements:
For sure the biggest one would be achieving more test coverage. I thought I was going to have lots of time to do it, but didn't, and that comes down to me not managing my time as well as I could have. I would ideally have liked to include all the stretch goals, including the ERD diagram and the custom queries, but again, that comes down to time management, and not being one-hundred per cent confident about writing the code in the first place.

Thank you,

Martin
